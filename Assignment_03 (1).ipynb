        "  - In Python, a function is simply a piece of code that performs a useful task and can be used again at any time.  You place the code within a function and call it when needed rather than writing it repeatedly.  In addition to returning a result, functions can accept inputs, often known as arguments.  A function is created by using the def keyword, naming it, and then following it with parentheses ().  If necessary, you can add arguments inside the parenthesis.  The real code is then written inside the function (with the appropriate indentation).  Return is used if you wish the function to return a result.\n",

        "    METHOD:-\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Like a function in Python, a method is an object-working member of a class.  It can be thought of as an action that an object is capable of.  Through the use of methods, classes specify how objects should behave.  A method always contains a parameter called self, which represents the object being called on.  A method and a function differ from one another primarily in this way.  You use the class keyword to establish a class before creating a method.  Although the initial parameter of methods is self, they are specified inside the class, just like functions.  A class instance is created in order to invoke the method.\n"

        "   - Function parameters and arguments in Python let you pass data into functions so they can process it.  A parameter is a variable that is defined in a function, but an argument is the value that is actually passed in when the function is called.  For instance, \"Alice\" is the argument when calling greet(\"Alice\"), and name is a parameter in def greet(name):.  Python has a variety of argument types.  Depending on their order in the function call, positional parameters are assigned.  The order is unimportant because you can define which parameter receives which value using keyword arguments.  With default arguments, a parameter is assigned a predefined value in the absence of an argument.  Because of these changes, functions may be designed with more flexibility and are more applicable to a variety of contexts.\n",

Functions can be used as methods in classes or nested within other functions.  Recursion is another useful approach in which a function solves a problem by calling itself.  Functions improve code organization, readability, and reusability.  To utilize a function, simply call its name with parentheses and give any necessary parameters.  Python's ease of defining and utilizing functions makes it ideal for handling a wide range of programming jobs fast and effectively.\n"

        "    - The return statement in Python is used to return a function's output to the caller.  When a function runs, it may analyze data, carry out calculations, or complete a task; the return allows it to pass the outcome.  The function would operate without it, but it would produce no output.  Numbers, text, lists, or even another function can all be returned by a function.  Python returns None by default if there isn't a return statement.  Functions become more flexible when you use tuples to return many values at once.  Proper use of return ensures that your code is reusable, effective, and tidy.  It facilitates the decomposition of intricate issues into smaller tasks, which makes your software simpler to administer and comprehend\n",

You can ask for the next item and it will remember where you left off.  However, an iterable does not remember where you are; it is simply something that you can loop over, such as a string or list.  You need an iterator to actually navigate through an iterable.  Python automatically transforms the iterable into an iterator when you use a for loop.  The main distinction is that although an iterator performs the actual iteration, one item at a time, an iterable can be iterated over.\n",

Because they continue where they left off without requiring additional variables, they help simplify and make your code easier to manage.

It’s useful when you need to transform data quickly. Then, filter() is for when you want to keep only the items that meet a certain condition. It checks each item, and if the function returns True, it keeps that item. Lastly, reduce() applies a function repeatedly to a list, reducing all the items to a single result, like summing or multiplying them. You need to import reduce() from functools, though.
